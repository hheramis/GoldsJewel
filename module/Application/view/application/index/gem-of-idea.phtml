			<h3>Travellers Tips</h3>
			<p>It's not what you spend or pack that makes your trip memorable; it's the state of mind you bring. Savor the differences. Be ready to ad-lib, to be imaginative while conquering surprise challenges. Make an art out of taking the unexpected in stride. Good travelers - like skiers bending their knees to make moguls more fun - enjoy the bumps in the road. Don't complicate your trip: simplify! Travelers can get stressed or waste time over the silliest things, which, in their niggling ways, can suffocate a happy holiday. Avoid unnecessary burdens. Ask questions all along the way. Make yourself an extrovert, even if you're not. Don't be afraid to butcher the language. Be a catalyst for adventure and excitement. Be open-minded. Absorb, accept, and learn. Much of the success of your trip will depend on the attitude you pack. If you can think positively, travel smartly, adapt well, and connect with the culture, you'll have a truly rich trip. So raise your travel dreams to their upright and locked positions, and let yourself fly away."</p>
